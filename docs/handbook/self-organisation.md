The leadership team

The purpose of the leadership team is to be accountable for delivering the overall goals of the business. For the 12 months to 30 September 2016 these goals are:

To move to a scalable pod-based delivery model for our work
To introduce a new lead technology alongside Drupal delivering approx 10% of turnover
To win 3 new client wins (>£150,000 pa spend) and 4 new client wins (>£75,000 pa spend)
To hire 15 new experienced team members across Canterbury and distributed locations
To recruit and train 5 new junior developers in Canterbury
To grow the annual digital agency business turnover to £2.91m (currently £1.95m)

The team comprises a number of roles  that are accountable for delivering different aspects of our goals for the next year. 

The team meets once per week for 90 minutes on Monday or Tuesday. It reviews progress on our goals and works to resolve issues that can’t be resolved by others.
What are the roles in the leadership team and who’s in the team?

While we don’t have management hierarchies in the traditional sense, accountabilities are nested as this reflects the nature of the roles we have and the way we work. For example all roles in the leadership team are accountable to Simon as the Agency Director. Simon is accountable to Tim as the company owner. They are servant leaders. 

The accountability chart shows the leadership team seats and who is in each seat.

How does the leadership team work?

As the group of people who are accountable for delivering the high level business goals for the agency, everyone on the leadership team needs to play their part in shaping direction and resolving the inevitable issues that come up in our work.

We expect all leadership team members to:

be great at being where they’re supposed to be and doing what they’re supposed to do
be able to commit to non-delivery tasks and execute them well
play out their role on the leadership team 
be able to contribute to broader discussions about the business openly and collaboratively
follow the game plan that’s set out as a team - which can mean wholeheartedly delivering on decisions they may not personally agree with. “Strong opinions, lightly held” is a mantra we all sign up to
be able to spot opportunities and engage broader team members in capitalising on those opportunities

The EOS blog has a useful description of how leadership team members need to be:

“As the business landscape changes in front of your organization, leaders have their heads up. They’re always alert, anticipating and watching for that next opening that will take your business to the next level. Team leaders suppress the fear of making a wrong decision, knowing that a decision must be made to keep the team moving forward. So they decide, and adjust quickly to correct the course if the need arises.”

The integrator seat is vital for the effective functioning of the leadership team. Constructive debate, trust, challenge and disagreement without fear are characteristics of a healthy team, but for the business to thrive and deliver at pace the integrator is accountable for making a decision and setting clear direction that is right for the entire business. In short, the integrator has the final word on leadership team decisions and how things move forward.

Cross-agency working

If we’re not careful pods could become silos. That’s why we also have chapters and guilds.

Chapters

A chapter is a group of people who do similar work. For example developers, UX-ers, designers. They share best practice, information, tips and are responsible to each other for mutual support in their work.

A member of the chapter will take on the role of chapter lead in addition to their specialist delivery responsibilities. 

The amount of time that a chapter lead will spend on these responsibilities will depend on how large and complex the chapter is. For the technical development chapter we expect the chapter lead to spend around two days per week fulfilling their responsibilities.

The chapter lead is responsible for:

establishing, sharing and maintaining professional best practice within the chapter 
professional learning and coaching for chapter members
acting as the senior expert for complex and tricky problems
championing innovation, creativity and development within the chapter

The accountabilities that chapter leads hold are broad so the chapter leads will meet with the directors every month to identify specific areas of work and resolve issues.

At launch we will have a chapter lead for technical development. We expect chapter leads for other areas to be needed as the number of team members in other disciplines grows.

Guilds

A guild is a group of people who do want to get together to share knowledge, tools and practices. It’s an informal group and anyone can join if they’re interested and want to contribute or participate. An example of a guild could be Design Den or Coder Lounge.

It’s really important that we encourage and support guilds. They’re really important to keeping us on top of our game and helping us take a step away from the day-to-day client work.

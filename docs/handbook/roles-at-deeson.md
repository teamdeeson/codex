# Roles at Deeson

This page describes the roles individuals take on at Deeson.

First up, some definitions before reading this page:

1. *Job roles* are the variety of functions an individual will play in either a project or company situation.
2. *Job titles* define a person’s position in the company and the one or more job roles for which they are expected to be expert in.

*Job roles* set expectations for the project, client and company and ensure someone is covering all the different aspects of what we do.

In some cases, individuals will perform more than one of the roles on a project. As an individual's responsibilities increase, they are likely to take on more roles. This allows individuals to grow and develop professionally by moving into new areas and working on new skills.

*Job titles* reflect the company baseline for an individual and what roles they are expected to excel at. They also represent milestones in a career as they define the roles an individual needs to work on to reach it.

## Shared accountabilities

Here are the specific accountabilities we all share regardless of our job title and role on any specific project:

* Client satisfaction
* Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec)
* Your own capacity
* Your own capability
* Supporting your colleagues
* Following company processes

## Project roles at Deeson

Our project management process is based on the Agile methodology called [DSDM Agile project framework](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/introduction-0) developed by the Agile Business Consortium. Project roles are distinct sets of responsibilities on a project. An individual on a project may hold one or more of these roles.

The diagram below shows the DSDM 'alien baby' diagram that shows the various project roles.

![Deeson project roles diagram](../images/deeson-project-structure.jpg)

The roles in the head are project governance roles, those in the body are the team that build and deliver the solution for the project. The roles in the shaded area are supporting the project and are not part of the project team. White roles are Deeson roles and orange roles are client or other external roles.

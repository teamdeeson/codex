## Technical roles

Within roles in the technical chapter, it is important we have the right mix of technical skills to deliver work. Our core technology skill areas are:

- Drupal
- WordPress
- HTML/CSS
- Angular
- Symfony
- React
- Laravel
- Devops

Developers at Deeson join the company with technical skills in at least one of these areas. 

We expect our developers to be interested and able enough to learn how to work in other areas listed, although we don’t expect everyone to be equally competent in each area. 

Deep specialisms in one or more area are a good thing and are encouraged through our quarterly OKR process.

Solutions Architects need to be able to know enough about all of these areas to be able to do their role effectively, but they’re likely to have deeper specialisms in one or more of these areas too.

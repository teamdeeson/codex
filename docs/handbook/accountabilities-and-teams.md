# Clear accountabilities

Accountability is about being impeccable with your word - doing what you say and saying what you do. 

Accountability is all about making, keeping and answering for your personal and professional commitments.

Accountability is vital in how we do things at Deeson.

There should be only one owner for all major responsibilities in the agency and everyone should understand who owns what. 

If everyone is responsible then ultimately no-one is responsible. 

There are three things that need to be in place to have long-term accountability in our agency:

- **Expectations** - we have to set clear expectations with and amongst teams
- **Buy-in** - team members must be involved in setting the expectations and agree that they are reasonable and achievable
- **Results** - team members need to understand the consequences of success or failure and how their accountability will directly affect the results

It’s important that everyone has clear accountabilities in their role. 

#Our delivery teams

We believe that our team members are best placed to decide how they work to deliver the projects we do for our clients. 

Self-organisation is a fundamental concept in agile project management. The Agile Manifesto
includes the principle “The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams”. 

##How does self-organisation work?

Our self-organising teams are called pods. 

A pod contains specialists in all the disciplines we need to be able to deliver projects as a self-contained unit. 

A pod takes on responsibility for a number of client build projects as well as ongoing maintenance and support for a number of sites.

Pods members work for themselves to deliver projects and don't wait for their pod lead to assign work. This helps ensure a greater sense of ownership and commitment. 

Pods manage their work (allocation, reallocation, estimation, reestimation, delivery, and rework) as a group. 

They still need mentoring and coaching, but they don't require "command and control”. 

They communicate more with each other, make sure they understand requirements and aren't afraid to ask questions to get their doubts clarified. 

They continuously enhance their own skills and recommend innovative ideas and improvements.

##What makes a successful pod?

We know that four things are important for a pod to be successful:

1. **Competency** - team members need to be competent to be able to deliver their accountabilities. This competency leads to confidence in their work and significantly reduces the need for direction that would have come from managers in traditional agency management structures.
2. **Collaboration** - pods work as a motivated and committed team rather than as a group of individuals. 
3. **Trust and respect** - for a team to be effective team members trust and respect each other. They believe in collective ownership of projects for our clients and are ready to go the extra mile to help each other resolve issues.
4. **Continuity** - for a pod team to get to know and trust each other they need to be together for a reasonable duration. Continuity is essential for the team. 

In practice this means we have a few principles that we hold about how pods work that we stick to. 

We only break these self-imposed rules with a discussion with the pod and leadership teams first:

- A pod must have a user experience consultant, a designer, a front-end developer, a solutions architect, an account manager and at least two developers.
- A pod has ten members at most. 
- We don’t share team members across pods.
- We keep all the same client projects in one pod.
- We don’t break the “golden thread” of a project by splitting discovery and production across pods.
- The creative roles within a pod are need to be co-located wherever possible.



## What are the roles in a pod?

It’s really important that we’re all clear what we are accountable for. 

That means it’s important to describe the accountabilities of the different roles that make up a pod. 

Having clear accountabilities doesn’t mean that we won’t work on things that other people are accountable for - for example in a strong football team a striker might drop back to defence if that’s what’s right for the team at that time. 

Above all we succeed and fail as a team in all we do. 

In practice that everyone working in our agency has a set of accountabilities in common as well as some seat specific accountabilities. 

For us to be at the top of our game we need everyone to be great at being where they’re supposed to be and doing what they’re supposed to do. 

Here are the specific accountabilities we all share:

- Client satisfaction
- Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec)
- Your own capacity
- Your own capability
- Supporting your colleagues
- Following company processes

Each role within the agency also has specific accountabilities. You can read more about those here.

## The pod lead

A common misconception about agile project management approaches is that because of the importance of self-organising teams, there is little or no role for leaders of agile teams. 

We need to be clear who’s accountable for what a pod does. 

There will always be conflicting priorities that need reconciling and someone needs to be the one who makes the final decision what the pod will do.

That role is called the *pod lead*. It’s a responsibility that a pod member holds in addition to their specialist role in the pod.

The pod lead could be anyone within the team with the right skills - a solutions architect, a developer, a UXer, designer or an AM. 

It’s about the pod lead having the right skills to facilitate the work of the team and make sound decisions about how to deliver well.

But that doesn’t mean the pod lead is a manager or team head. 

Instead of daily hands-on managing and assigning work, the pod lead is as a mentor and problem solver to facilitate the team being effective. They are a servant leader. 

Ultimately they are the person with the final call on what the team does if the team can’t reach a consensus on how to hit a goal, but that should, over time, be the exception rather than the rule. 

##Company-wide processes and policies

Pods should be free to do what they need to do to get the job done. 

That’s our primary aim, but in an agency we need to have some standard practices that hold us together, as well as the freedoms to work how we need to so that we can deliver great work for our clients.

Here’s a quick rundown of what’s a company-wide standard:

- EOS methods and tools
- Our delivery methodology - the three stage Discovery, Production and Optimisation approach
- The Deeson Scrum delivery methodology
- Estimating methodology
- Recruitment
- Goals and development
- Company business policies (HR, environmental etc)
- The Deeson Handbook and codex
- Roles and accountabilities
- Company-wide tools
- Discipline-specific software, tools and standards- eg development environments
- Reporting standards and tools - eg report cards
- Our time recording tool - Harvest
- Our forecasting tool - Forecast
- Business systems - Macs, Google Drive, email etc

If the company-wide standard tool or process isn’t working as well as you think it could or you think there’s a better way, get a guild together and recommend a better way for consideration.

##Questions and answers about pod working

###Who’s in charge of what I do?

You are. 

Our pods are self-organising teams that include all the people with the skills needed to deliver the kind of projects our clients want. 

We don’t have a management hierarchy because we believe that the best way for a team to work is for team members themselves to work out the best way to hit the team’s goals.

###Who’s my line manager?

Ultimately your line manager is a director (Simon or Andrew). Your pod lead approves holiday requests as they are accountable for the delivery capacity of a pod.

You are accountable for delivering your professional development through our self-development process (also known as OKRs). 

Your chapter lead and the directors are responsible for supporting your professional development. 

Directors look after all other line management functions (such as pay, performance improvement, career progression, sickness, welfare and long-term absence, disciplinary, grievance, and appraisals).

###Who's in which pod?

You can see details of who does what in each pod here. 

###Which clients / projects are in each pod?

You can see this in the project overview list.

###How do I know how my pod is doing?

We have a company and pod dashboard that’s available for everyone in the company to see. 

The scorecard is updated at the start of each week and shows the key numbers that show how the company and pod is doing against its goals:

#How do I get in?

If you don’t have an access card -  at ground floor reception say you’re going to the Gridiron / Office Group, they will send you to the 8th floor reception. They will then give you access to the 7th floor. Ground floor security may let you go direct to the 7th.

If you have an access card you need to swipe to access the lift, then go to the 7th floor.

There is an exit from King’s Cross St Pancras that leads to the base of the building (the ‘light tunnel’ exit).

If I don’t have a key to the Deeson office room, there is a key safe on the office door. The code to open it is 265. Please make sure replace it when you leave so it's there for the next person who needs it.

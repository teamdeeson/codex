Tools, purchasing and equipment
I really need Widget X to work from home better? Why haven’t we experimented with Tech Y already?

The company provides a laptop and core software. In the office the company also provides screens, internet, stationery and heating on a good day.

But most of us also have extra tools we need to be able to do our work efficiently. That might be a bit of kit to use with your Mac, some specialist software or some hardware you want to experiment with. 

The company provides a budget of up to £500 to each team member each year to spend at their discretion on anything that helps them do their job at Deeson better. 

What you spend that on is up to you - spend the money like it was your own. But don’t just spend it because it’s there - money is obviously a valuable resource we’ve all worked hard for.

No-one pre-approves what you spend it on. Be prepared to share the resource with your colleagues if need be.

To use your allowance, buy the item/service/thing, add it to the tool list and add to ReceiptBank for approval. Where possible get someone with a company card to make the payment, although you can buy it on a personal credit card and be reimbursed by BACS.
How do I purchase equipment for the office, print for a client etc?

Purchases by credit card are sent through ReceiptBank for approval. Purchases that are paid for later or that require a purchase order are entered via Xero only. Nothing needs to be added in both places.
Does this include pens / paper / maracas / iPads?

The company will supply printers, toner and printer paper. 

Beyond that you should buy what you need using your budget and look after it, this includes consumables such as notepads.
What if I run out of budget?

If you’ve used it effectively and you need more then you’ll get more.
Who’s responsible for looking after what I buy?

You. Buying resources at a company level is really inefficient - they often get lost or no one knows where they are when they need them, so they get bought again and again. 

Or we lose expensive things like iPads before a pitch because it’s everyone’s and no-one’s responsibility to look after them.

This is a waste of time searching for it, money buying it and bad for the environment - 100 AA batteries of unknown charge in a drawer is a fail.
The small print

Anything you buy remains company property. 

You need to take good care of it and if you leave you need to return it along with other company kit. 

If you’re using it for non-work purposes and you break it then you need to replace it at your cost.

There’s an open list of who’s got/bought what so that everyone can share. The onus is on you to check that we aren’t buying small amounts inefficiently, to get the best deal and that we don’t already have five Segways in the cellar.
Tool story! - Jane explores whether wearable tech is a fad

Jane has seen a lot of buzz on Twitter about a new Android smartwatch that she thinks would be interesting to explore. 

She does some internet research and reads about how people are experimenting with the equipment and how it can work with existing content management frameworks like Drupal. 

She thinks we could win some new work if we can demonstrate it’s useful to a client.

She’d like to explore this further so orders a watch that’s shipped in from the USA the next week. 

She uses a colleague’s company credit card to pay for it and the purchase is logged on Xero as normal.

When the watch arrives she uses it herself for a few weeks to see how it works and what it’s good for. 

She also hacks together a quick technical prototype to show how it could be used in a client project she’s working on. 

She shows this to the rest of the project team and demos how she made it work.

The next month the watch is used as part of a pitch to a potential new client to demonstrate an innovative new concept that helps us differentiate ourselves against other digital agencies.

Expenses, pay and recruitment bonus

Any rules of thumb for expenses?

Yes, some simple ones:

spend it was like it was your own
use the most effective form of travel considering the environment, convenience, time and cost
If you’re working away from your normal working location (Canterbury, London or home), it’s ok to claim for food and subsistence expenses

How do I claim expenses?

You claim out of pocket expenses (travel, subsistence and accommodation) via ReceiptBank. Purchases of equipment and supplies are handled differently, see the Tool section.

Supporting documentation (e.g. receipts) should be attached in Harvest and billed to the project.

Repayments will be made by BACS.

If I go by car?

Then you should ideally hire one for insurance and cost reasons. If there’s a reason not to and you’ve got appropriate commercial use insurance then mileage for cars and motorcycles is paid at standard rates. 

When does my salary get paid?

On the first working day of each month.
What’s the recruitment bonus?

We’re always looking for more great people to join our team. And we know that our existing team members often know people who would be a great fit for what we do. That’s why we have our recruitment bonus. 

We pay a bonus of £750 to say thank you to current team members who do something beyond the scope of their everyday job that leads to a new team member accepting a permanent position with us. 

A referral is when you doing something beyond the scope of your everyday job that leads to the candidate applying for a relevant role and subsequently being successful in their application, e.g. contacting a member of your existing network or meeting someone at a conference and inviting them to apply.

All you need to do to claim the bonus is let the recruitment lead know who you’re introducing. The candidate will go through our normal recruitment process and if they’re successful, we’ll pay the £750 when they sign their contract. 

For referrals where more than one team member claims the bonus, you’ll need to agree how to split the bonus among yourselves. 

Remember the bonus isn’t payable when a candidate contacts us directly as a result of any of our existing recruitment marketing - it’s about helping us meet people we wouldn’t have otherwise met.

#Personal goals and development

We believe that to be able to do their best work, everyone needs clear goals that are linked to the bigger goals that we’ve got as a company as well as personal aspirations and interests.

As an agency we have a longstanding strong commitment to helping team members pursue their personal development goals. However we’ve not been as good as we could be in helping team members set and achieve personal development goals.

This section of the handbook explains how we set goals and ensure that everyone gets the right feedback to help them achieve those goals. This is a new approach that we’re introducing for a six month trial from April 2016.

This section applies to everyone at the agency after their first year with us. We have a different process for supporting team members through their first year in the agency (link to year one section in handbook).
The basics of goal setting

Everyone will be setting themselves clear goals each quarter. 

These are called your objectives and key results (OKRs) - what you will achieve in this quarter to help your pod - both to help the company achieve its quarterly business goals and to help you achieve your personal and professional goals.
##How are goals set?

We use an established approach for this. It’s called “Objectives and Key Results” which is usually abbreviated to “OKRs”.

OKRs were invented at Intel Corporation and some of the biggest tech companies in the world use OKRs including Google, Zynga, Upstart and many others. There’s plenty of material online about how different companies have used OKRs. We particularly like this First Round Review article.

We set OKRs each quarter to fit with our quarterly planning cycle for company goals. Everyone at Deeson has their own OKRs. We considered setting OKRs at a pod level but to keep things simple we won’t be doing that at this stage.

An OKR at Deeson is made up of: 

a high level objective
a more detailed description of why that objective is important - this could be because it supports a company goal or your own professional development goals
a summary of how the objective aligns with the broader goals of the company
the three to five key results that will show whether the goal is achieved 
a summary of any support you might need to achieve your OKR
information about who’s helped you set this OKR

Key results should be quantifiable, achievable, lead to objective grading and be difficult, but not impossible. OKR results can be based on growth, performance, revenue or engagement. 
Often they are numerical, but they can also show if something is done or not done, so a binary 0 or 1.

During the trial period we’re expecting everyone to have three or four OKRs for each quarter. 

Each team member is responsible for setting their own OKRs, with advice from other members of the agency as they feel necessary. In practice, this probably means you need to get advice and guidance from a pod lead, chapter lead and/or director, but who you involve is up to you depending on the nature of your goals. 

All OKRs are shared and reported on publicly so everyone knows what everyone else is aiming to do.

We’re expecting everyone to achieve 75% of their OKRs each quarter.

Some companies using OKRs expect their team members to achieve 100% of their OKRs, while others expect a lower percentage achievement because they want team members to set stretching goals and understand that if you do this, it’s ok to not hit every OKR as long as you learn what to do better next time.

The twist that the OKR approach adds is that you must define multiple key results. That’s because no metric is perfect, and it’s best to look at each objective from multiple angles. Don’t get all hung up over one target. If one target fails, it’s not a problem. You have others.
##What do I need to do to be able to set my OKRs?

To be able to set OKRs effectively there are four things you need to do:

You need to make sure you understand the agency’s goals for the next quarter 
You need to have got feedback from three other people in the agency - it’s up to you who you get feedback from, but typically it’s useful to ask two questions to people you work with closely (“what do I do well?” and “what could I do differently?”)
You need to have thought about your personal goals and career direction
You need to review your OKRs with your pod lead and chapter lead and ensure they agree with them and understand the support you’re asking for
What should I put into my OKRs?

Your development priorities are up to you to identify and own. Your personal development is a commitment that you make to investing in your own skills, capability and confidence. 

But it’s really important you get advice from the right people to help you frame achievable but stretching personal development goals and particularly to think about what you’ll need to do and the support you’ll need.
##Show me some example OKRs, please!

Here are some sample OKRs that we’ve put together to help explain how this might work:


OKR: 1
Objective:
To learn how to build a basic site using Drupal 8
Why is this important:
In the future I will need to build sites using Drupal 8 in my role as a developer so it’s important that I gain this knowledge now before we start our first client Drupal 8 project.
Company alignment:
This supports the company’s quarter 2 goal of “Have a credible portfolio of three Drupal 8 websites with capability to deliver D8 for clients”.
Key results
I have built a publicly visible Drupal 8 website by 31 March 2016
I have written a blog post about an aspect of Drupal 8
I have shared knowledge internally about Drupal 8 through a brown bag lunch talk

What suppport do I need?
I need a real website to work on and build that the company is happy to launch publicly
I’ll be putting in 10 hours of my personal time to help me learn Drupal 8 and attend a meet-up in London
I need six days in my schedule to put towards building the public website in my key results.
I may need some ad-hoc time from my chapter lead to help me resolve blockers and make strategic decisions about how to build the D8 site

Who have I consulted?
I discussed this with John (Chapter Lead) and Simon (Director) before I set this OKR.


OKR: 2
Objective:
To become an effective member of the pitch team
Why is this important:
We need to improve the way we pitch to new clients to help us win new projects that are a good fit for us as an agency and the work that we want to do.
Company alignment:
This supports the company’s quarter 2 goal of “Win £50k of work by end of March that we wouldn’t have done previously”.
Key results
I know and have used the blueprint process for pitches
I am a confident and competent presenter
I’ve participated in a real pitch

What suppport do I need?
I need someone to explain the blueprint process to me before I start
I need feedback from team members who hear me present to help me improve my technique.
Joining a speakers’ club on a Monday evening. I’ll be investing two hours of personal time in this to help me achieve my goal.

Who have I consulted?
Feedback from other pod team members helped me come up with this OKR. I spoke with Andrew (Creative Director) and Will (New business) to make sure I focussed on the right areas.

##When do I set my OKRs?

We set OKRs and personal development goals each quarter - in first working week of each quarter. 

Our business quarters are:

Q1 - October, November, December
Q2 - January, February, March
Q3 - April, May, June
Q4 - July, August, September

So for the first quarter in the trial, everyone needs to have set their goals by 30 April 2016.
##How are my OKRs reviewed?

Once you’ve set your OKRs, each month during the quarter you’ll need to rate your progress on each key result you’ve set out. This rating is a simple 0 to 100% rating, with 100% being the result has been fully delivered.
What kind of support can I get to help me achieve my OKRs?

When you set your OKRs you need to think about what support you need. Support can be anything reasonable that makes it more likely that you’ll be able to accomplish your goal.

This support might include a specific training course or qualification, an opportunity to work on a different kind of project to gain different experience, time in your schedule, pair working or mentoring. This list isn’t exhaustive - you need to think about what’s relevant to your goal and be as specific as you can.
I never get any time for personal development. Help!

You are responsible for your own schedule and for working with your pod colleagues to fulfil your project responsibilities and achieving your development goals. 

If your chapter lead and pod lead has agreed support for your development goal that includes some company time, then make sure you put that time into your schedule. In practice only you can effectively balance project and personal development time so make sure you’re regularly managing your schedule and commitments to ensure you achieve both.

There will be many development goals where you need to invest some of your own time too. It’s important to be realistic about this when setting your goals to ensure that you have enough time, both at work and at home, to invest in your personal development.
##How do we keep track of OKRs?

Having an open and accessible way of recording what everyone’s OKRs are, how they’re going and what support they’re getting is really important. It’ll help everyone see where there might be opportunities to collaborate on learning, mentoring and development. 

During the six month trial we’ll be using a simple Google Docs based system for recording goals and logging progress. After that we’ll look at the best way of continuing with recording and tracking goals. There are a range of SaaS options or we may continue with the Google Docs based system. In the first six months our focus needs to be on getting OKRs up and running properly and iterating how we do this.
##So what do I need to do and when?

Make sure you understand what this section of the handbook says. Ask any questions you might have (ask Pete, Adam, Sara, Cat, Rachael or Simon)
Find out what the company’s goals are for this quarter.
Think about and set your draft OKRs for April, May and June. Use the single OKR tracker spreadsheet.
Review your OKRs with your pod and chapter lead.
Finalise your OKRs by 30 April 2016.
At the end of each month update the tracker spreadsheet with your progress.

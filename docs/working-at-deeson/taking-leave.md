#Holidays, charity days and sabbaticals

##Holidays

There are 24 days paid leave per calendar year, plus UK bank holidays. For team members based outside the UK there may be individual variations to this based on local public holidays.

You will have to take the time for our Christmas to New Year company wide close down period from your allowance each year - this is usually three or four days of leave and will be automatically booked for you at the start of each calendar year.

To book holiday make appropriate plans for your schedule, confirm with the colleagues it affects and then request via [Who’s Off] (http://www.whosoff.com).

You can use holiday in half days or whole days. On a half day you either start or finish at 12.30pm.

Your billable % target stays the same and your target hours reduce proportionately (e. 1 day in a week off means your billable hours reduce by 1/5th.)

For pod team members holiday requests are approved by your pod lead. For everyone it's approved by the MD.

##Charity days


##Sabbaticals

Holiday, sick and charity days

The Deeson sabbatical policy is here.
How does holiday work?

What about medical appointments?

These should be incorporated into your flexible time wherever possible, otherwise requested via Who’s Off.
What if I’m sick?

There are ten paid sick days per calendar year. Speak to your line manager (or a director if not available) as soon possible each day. 
How is compassionate leave handled?

In some situations compassionate leave may be granted, for example in the event of the death of an immediate family member or grandparent.
What are charity days?

We provide paid time off to staff who want to volunteer for a charity/good cause.

The guidelines are:

It must be a registered charity or operate by the same principles;
That you advise people what you intend to do and what you actually did. This is to encourage others and give insight. You may be asked to write a blog to illustrate the activity.
We’re not planning for more than three days per calendar year per person.
The activity should be discussed with a director and recorded in WhosOff

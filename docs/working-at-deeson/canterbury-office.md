...work in the Canterbury office?

The building at 27 Castle Street is our home in Canterbury.
Where do I sit/stand?

Wherever’s the most effective place to achieve our principles. If you want to sit in the same place each day, that’s fine. But if you want to move around the office and sit with different people that’s fine too.

How do I get in?

You’ll be given a fob that opens the rear doors when the building. Most people also have keys and an alarm fob so they can unlock the building in the morning and lock up at night.  If you’re locking up, make sure you’ve followed the checklist near the back door before setting the alarm and leaving.
